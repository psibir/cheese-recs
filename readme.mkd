# Cheese-Recs

A cheese recommendation website


## Description

This web application recommends cheeses based on user input and uses TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity to find similar cheeses. The application then returns the top recommendations, excluding any cheeses with qualities specified by the user to be excluded.

## Business Use Case

This project could be useful for a cheese retailer or distributor to provide personalized recommendations to their customers. By asking customers about their preferences and excluding any qualities they do not like, the retailer can provide a curated list of cheeses that are more likely to be appealing to the customer. This could increase customer satisfaction and potentially lead to higher sales.

## Technical Explanation

The code is implementing a cheese recommendation system using the TF-IDF algorithm and cosine similarity.

The `CheeseRecommender` class initializes with a file path for a tab-separated values (tsv) file containing information on various cheeses. The data is loaded into a pandas DataFrame, and a TfidfVectorizer is created to transform the cheese descriptions into a matrix of TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) values.

The `get_recommendations` method takes in user input, number of recommendations, starting index, and a list of words to exclude from the recommendation. If the user does not provide any input or exclusion words, the method generates a random sample of cheese recommendations. If the user provides input, the user's input is transformed into a vector using the same TfidfVectorizer used on the cheese descriptions, and the cosine similarity between the user input vector and the cheese matrix is calculated. The method returns the top recommendations with the highest cosine similarity scores. If exclude words are provided, the method removes any cheeses containing the excluded words from the recommendations.
